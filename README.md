# random-solar-system
Using spelljammer rolling tables, generate (and then draw?) a random solar system

Kind of a mess, most of it was last worked on in 2022. 

Plan was:
- spelljammerSolar.py generates and spits out a json file of planets and solar system, etc
- one of the various drawing files then takes that json and turns it into an svg, didn't finish that one
- flirted with the idea of using flask to make it a web page, didn't really get far
